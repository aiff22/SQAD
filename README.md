SQAD: Automatic Smartphone Camera Quality Assessment and Benchmarking<br>

TODO List:
[] add codes for model training
[] add pre-trained models
[] add tables for baseline results

## Train the model
For ResNet50-based backbone, there is **no** specific requirement for the environment settings. Just make sure you have installed *pytorch* and *Pillow* properly. If there are some package related issues, follow the error instructions.<br>

For the evaluations with MANIQA, please follow the guidelines provided by [CVPRW 2022: MANIQA](https://github.com/IIGROUP/MANIQA). Thanks for their great works on image quality assessment.
